# Photo Draw

My app for the 2022 Swift Student Challenge.

'Photo Draw' is a neat little drawing app with an amazing trick up its sleeve. It allows you to convert images with handwriting or line drawings to vector paths. These paths can then be manipulated exactly like they were drawn directly on your device. It's perfect for those who prefer the feel of paper or students who want to digitize what's on the board in the classroom!

## Why did I make this app?

There's something to be said for the focussed task of writing on pen and paper. You can't get distracted by notifications in a Muji notebook like you can when writing on an iPad. However, the digital writing and drawing experience can be better at times. With digital ink, if you want to move something to make more space, you can simply select and move it. And if you want to change the color, you can pick a new one. 

For years I wished there was a way to convert my notes on paper to digital. Better yet if I could easily take a photo of the chalkboard in class and have all of the math written there editable in my notes. So I decided to make an app that can do just that!

### Disclaimers

The image path finding algorithm I implemented uses the process outlined in the paper [A complete hand-drawn sketch vectorization framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05902.pdf) by L. Donati, S. Cesano, and A. Prati.

**This app was tested with Xcode 13.3 and should be compiled using Xcode rather than Swift Playgrounds 4.**

Test on an iPad for the best experience :)
