# Photo Draw

My app for the 2022 Swift Student Challenge.

'Photo Draw' is a neat little drawing app with an amazing trick up its sleeve. It allows you to convert images with handwriting or line drawings to vector paths. These paths can then be manipulated exactly like they were drawn directly on your device. It's perfect for those who prefer the feel of paper or students who want to digitize what's on the board in the classroom!

## Why did I make this app?



### Disclaimers

The image path finding algorithm I implemented uses the process outlined in the paper [A complete hand-drawn sketch vectorization framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05902.pdf) by L. Donati, S. Cesano, and A. Prati.

**This app was tested with Xcode 13.3 and should be compiled using Xcode rather than Swift Playgrounds 4.**
